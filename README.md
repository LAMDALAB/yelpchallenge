# Yelp Dataset Challenge
Round 7 Of The Yelp Dataset Challenge

We’ve had 6 rounds, over $40,000 in cash prizes awarded, hundreds of academic papers written, and we are excited to see round 7.

Our dataset has been updated for this iteration of the challenge - we’re sure there are plenty of interesting insights waiting there for you. This set includes information about local businesses in 10 cities across 4 countries.

This round also includes a new type of data - photos! These photos nicely complement reviews, business attributes, check-ins, and tips, and open the door to even more exciting research. An auxiliary file has been provided for download (see the "Get the Data" link on this page), containing 200,000 pictures from 41,658 businesses described in the main dataset. The photo archive includes a json file linking each photo to its corresponding business in the dataset, and listing its caption (if any), and type of content as determined by our image classifier (we currently only list labels for some restaurants).

This treasure trove of local business data is waiting to be mined and we can’t wait to see you push the frontiers of data science research with our data.

** If you are a student and meet our eligibility criteria, you can submit your research findings to us by June 30, 2016 to be considered for the $5,000 Dataset Challenge Award.
